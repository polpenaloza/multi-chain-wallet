# **Multi-Chain Wallet Integration**

## **Objective:**

Develop a React-based frontend application that enables users to connect wallets for multiple blockchain protocols (EVM, Solana, and UTXO) and displays their wallet balances. The solution must be implemented using TypeScript

## Requirements

1. Wallet Connectivity
   - Implement wallet connection functionality for the following blockchain ecosystems:
     - EVM-based blockchains: Only one EVM wallet can be connected at the same time
     - Solana blockchain
     - Bitcoin
   - One Wallet from each ecosystem (e.g., one EVM, one Solana, and one Bitcoin wallet) can be connected simultaneously.
   - Provide a simple and intuitive user interface for connecting each type of wallet.
2. Token List
   - Use the [LI.FI](http://LI.FI) API to query a list of all supported tokens and display that list on the frontend
   - Make sure the rendering of that list is optimized
3. Display Balances
   - After connecting a wallet, fetch and display the actual wallet's balances for each ecosystem in that token list
   - Ensure the UI dynamically updates when wallets are connected or disconnected.
4. Write a set of unit tests that test above functionality

## **Deliverables**

1. A React + TypeScript application with the following functionality defined above
2. Documentation, including:
   - Readme file with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the application locally.
   - Documentation of design decisions and assumptions made during the implementation.
   - Description of any blockers, challenges, or constraints encountered while building the solution.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Code Quality and Structure**
   - Clear and consistent naming conventions.
   - Logical and scalable folder/file structure.
   - Use of TypeScript best practices, including proper type definitions.
   - Effective error handling and robust code.
2. **Documentation**
   - Readability of the documentation and its ability to guide a new developer to set up and understand the project.
   - Thorough explanation of design decisions and assumptions.
   - Highlighting of challenges and blockers encountered during development.
3. **Adherence to UI/UX Standards**
   - A simple, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Clear display and dynamic updates of wallet balances.
4. **Functionality**
   - Successful implementation of wallet connection for EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin blockchains.
   - Correct and efficient fetching and display of wallet balances.
   - Smooth handling of connection and disconnection events.
